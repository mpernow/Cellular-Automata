This repo contains code to create some simple cellular automata. 

Class definitions contained in cellAut.py and example usage is demonstrated in run.py. Allows for rules of any odd length.

Todo: 
* Better plotting functionality
* Display rules (?)
* More checks (eg if rule is larger than size,...)
* Even-length  rule
* Genetic algorithm to get the "majority-computing" cellAut rule
